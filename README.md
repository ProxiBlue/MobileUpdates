=============

Simple Config Directive script to setup Magento Matched Expressions for better mobile device detection.

See block post located here : http://www.proxiblue.com.au/blog/magento-design-matched-expression/

In magento the Matched Expressions are matched on a 'first come, First Served Design' basis.

Thus, if you have Android in the matched expression, any android device will load that design (in most cases the mobile theme)

This is not ideal, as tablets would be able to give a better experience to end-users on the full site.

I use the following setup to target tablets better. 

The list is not complete, and I would appreciate additional identifiers added by users.
